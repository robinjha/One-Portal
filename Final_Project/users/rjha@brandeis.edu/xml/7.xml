President-Elect Frederick Lawrence (Williams ?77) and President Jehuda Reinharz Ph.D. ?72 (Columbia/Jewish Theological Seminary ?67) fielded questions from about three dozen students as part of ?When We Were Seniors,? a program arranged by the Senior Class Gift Committee. The hour-long question-and-answer session was followed by a reception featuring ?Sax Appeal,? an all-saxophone student group.
